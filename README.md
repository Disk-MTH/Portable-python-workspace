### Portable python workspace (documentation)


/!\ The original [python copyright](https://www.python.org/) applies here!


1) Download:


You can download the workspaces zipped in the [releases](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/Portable-python-workspace/releases). Once downloaded, unzip it to use it.


2) Use it:


To use it you just have to be in the folder and execute `python.exe your_file_path` or `pythonw.exe your_file_path` (You can find the difference between "python.exe" and "pythonw.exe" [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9705982/pythonw-exe-or-python-exe).). You can also set the environment variables to set this python as the system python environment.


3) Pip:


To use pip you have to type `python.exe -m pip your_arguments` and it works like regular python. If libraries are installed and you run a program as said above, everything should work normally.
